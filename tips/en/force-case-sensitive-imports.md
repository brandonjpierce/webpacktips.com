Some environments are case insensitive (such as macOS and windows), whereas an environment like linux _is_ case sensitive. This plugin forces case sensitivity to ensure that the filesystem in in tact no matter the environment.

Dependencies:
  - `case-sensitive-paths-webpack-plugin`

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    new CaseSensitivePathsPlugin()
  ]
  ...
};
```
